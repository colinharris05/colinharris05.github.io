  <p class='descriptionText'>
		Working with a group of 5 other interns, we were asked to create a log viewer that could provide solutions to customers' problems. As our team split into smaller groups, I chose to work on the front-end. With the help of AngularJS and some internal Dell styling sheets, I was able to create a fantastic website. In order to communicate with our back-end, we used C# and <a href='http://nancyfx.org/'>NancyFX</a> to build out an API. After learning so much about AngularJS throughout the summer I was inspired to make this site with it! The times I would work on the back-end I was working with some other great technologies including Owin/Katana and SignalR. I'm continuting to work with Dell through the end of 2015. It has been an amazing learning experience so far, with much more to come.</p>

		While at Maverick Software Consulting I worked remotely with Thomson Reuters employees developing web pages for a testing environment utilized by 400+ testers over at Thomson Reuters. Mostly using C#, I worked on creating new webpages and testing functionality. I also experimented with API creation using tools such as <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en'>PostMan</a> and <a href='http://www.telerik.com/fiddler'>Fiddler</a>. I took advantage of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern throughout the process. The experience taught me about basic web development, how an API really works, and was my first experience working with a large team on a huge preexisting file system.</p>
