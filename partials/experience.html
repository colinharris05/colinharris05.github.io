     Working with a group of 5 other interns, we were asked to create a log viewer that could provide solutions to customers' problems. As our team split into smaller groups, I chose to work on the front-end. With the help of AngularJS and some internal Dell styling sheets, I was able to create a fantastic website. In order to communicate with our back-end, we used C# and <a href='http://nancyfx.org/'>NancyFX</a> to build out an API. After learning so much about AngularJS throughout the summer I was inspired to make this site with it! The times I would work on the back-end I was working with some other great technologies including Owin/Katana and SignalR. I'm continuting to work with Dell through the end of 2015. It has been an amazing learning experience so far, with much more to come.

     While at Maverick Software Consulting I worked remotely with Thomson Reuters employees developing web pages for a testing environment utilized by 400+ testers over at Thomson Reuters. Primarily using C#, I created new webpages and testing functionality. I also experimented with API tools such as <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en'>PostMan</a> and <a href='http://www.telerik.com/fiddler'>Fiddler</a>. I took advantage of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern throughout the process. The experience taught me about basic web development, how to interact with APIs, and was my first experience working with a team on a large code base.
