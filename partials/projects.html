     <h3>C (Arduino), JavaScript</h3>
     <p>During Madison's first ever Hackathon, I worked with two other friends to make a robotic bartender. We decided on the idea before the hackathon and started ordering some of the hardware. We decided to use an Arduino to power seven different servo motors. Depending on the serial data that we sent the Arduino, it would turn the correct bottle. The cup sits on top of the scale, so that we are able to keep track of how much liquid has been poured into the cup. We had a Rasberry Pi running a server, and connected it directly to the Arduino. The person ordering a drink would use our mobile app to choose their drink and desired size, and the server would parse the information and send serial data to the Arduino. The project was insanely fun to work on and we ended up being in the top three finishers for the Most Mad Hack category.</p>
